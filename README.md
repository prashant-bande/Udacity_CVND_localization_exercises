# Computer Vision Nanodegree Program, Localization Exercises

This repository contains code exercises and materials for Udacity's [Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) program. It consists of tutorial notebooks that demonstrate, or challenge you to complete, object motion and localization methods. These notebooks depend on a number of software packages to run, and so, we suggest that you create a local environment with these dependencies by following the instructions in the [linked set of instructions](https://github.com/udacity/CVND_Exercises/blob/master/README.md).
